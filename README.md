# DESCRIPTION

This project is a mobile prototype of an AI voice assistant app designed using Figma and ProtoPie. The goal was to simulate an interactive assistant that responds to user voice commands. The interface includes two main screens: a confirmation screen and a listening screen. On the listening screen, when the user taps the microphone icon, the assistant plays a real voice recording saying “Set the AC to 22 degrees,” using ProtoPie's Media trigger. The prototype also displays a visual cue with the text “Listening...” and an animated AI character, creating a realistic conversational experience. The UI elements were created in Figma and imported into ProtoPie, where interactive logic was applied. Key features include voice feedback using real audio, scene transitions, and interaction handling through Tap, Speak, and Media triggers. Through this project, I learned how to integrate real voice interactions in a prototype, connect Figma designs with ProtoPie logic, and simulate natural assistant behavior using both visual and audio elements.
